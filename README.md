# Overview
The Simple Cart Picker is a React.js application that allows users to create a non-persistent record of items they want to purchase. It provides an intuitive interface for adding items to a cart and proceeding to checkout.

# Features
Add Items to Cart: Users can browse a list of available items and add them to their cart with a simple click.

Cart Management: The app allows users to view their selected items in the cart, adjust quantities, and remove items they no longer want.

Checkout: When ready, users can proceed to checkout, which simulates the purchase process without actual payment processing.

Non-Persistent Record: The app does not store user data or cart selections beyond the current session, ensuring privacy and simplicity.
